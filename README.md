# Visualization-Project

## Idea
I will create a graph that displays the snowfall in a given city. The x-axis will be of the time period (explained later in this paragraph)
and the y-axis will be the snowfall in inches and centimeters to accommodate for people in other parts of the world. The x-axis will change to go from snowfall that day (the time of day and how much it's supposed to snow that day) to average snowfall in 1 month to a full year. 
On the day, the high and low snowfall will be displayed with a number next to the most it will snow in a day and at what time (hours from 00:00 to 23:59)=; on the month, it will show how many days of the month had snow and what was the most it snowed in a given day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc); on the year it will tell which month had the most snow and what the average snowfall was that month.
